              Most of us reach a point in our lives when we begin to feel that
              it is time for change, but when we recognize how difficult it is
              to alter our existing patterns of thinking and behaviors we tend
              to give up. This in turn leads to further avoidance, fears,
              disappointments, and decreased motivation. Ultimately these
              experiences can leave you feeling anxious or depressed, lead to
              difficulties in relationships, and have you living an unhappy
              life. Although it may feel like a dead end, in reality there are
              many ways in which you could be helped. Psychotherapy is a process
              through which you can explore your issues, improve insight into
              what is holding you back, and develop efficient ways to deal with
              your problems.
